### PR Needed
1. More levels
2. Better graphics
3. Music and sound effects
4. Implementing some special drops from the bricks, penetrating ball, laser gun to the paddle etc etc..
5. Creating more of the maze part of the game, there are holes in the "ceiling" and the walls that the ball can go through and can have secret levels and such
6. Different kind of bricks, moving ones, hanging from chains, invisible etc..
